### Inroduction

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Nodejs <br>

MERN stack is full stack <br>

Full stack it requires code running on the server and code running on the browser <br>

The code that runs on the server is referred to as back-end and the code that runs on the browser is reffered to as front-end <br>

The front end and backend are two completely separate  code repository <br>

In a large enterprise full stack project there may be team and developers working on Front End and separate team of developers <br>
working on Back-end <br>
