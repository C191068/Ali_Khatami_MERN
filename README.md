# Ali_Khatami_MERN(Leaning from the video of Dave Gray)

### Inroduction

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Nodejs <br>

MERN stack is full stack <br>

Full stack it requires code running on the server and code running on the browser <br>

The code that runs on the server is referred to as back-end and the code that runs on the browser is reffered to as front-end <br>

The front end and backend are two completely separate  code repository <br>

In a large enterprise full stack project there may be team and developers working on Front End and separate team of developers <br>
working on Back-end <br>

As a full stack developer one should have the ability to work both on back end and front end <br>

Back end for the Mern stack is REST API <br>

REST API also known as RESTful API is an interface thet two computer systems use to excahnge informtion securely <br>
over the Internet(Amazon web services) <br>

The backend will recive request from the front end <br>


Those request can be clssified as CRUD operations <br>

Full form of CRUD is Create, Read , Update and Delete <br>

These methods also defines which type of http request method will be used in applications <br>

For example Post realtes to Create <br>

Get relates to Read <br>

Patch or Put relates to Update <br>

Delete has the exact match because DELETE=DELETE <br>
